    <h1>Hello, I&#39;m Rob Stenzinger. UX designer, interactive maker, and instructor.</h1>
    <p><img src="/images/Drawing_Journey_Maps_-_Part_4_-_Making_the_Journey_Map_-_Step_4_-_Adding_Wider_Perspective.jpg?v=1700586207476" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
    <p>As a ux generalist I&#39;ve worked on many platforms bringing human centered design to apps, data, games, virtual reality, smart products, and <strong>so much web</strong>. I&#39;ve spent the past 20+ years working with organizations of all sizes from startups, and not-for-profits, to companies you likely know in technology, education, finance, and retail.</p>

    <h2>Reach out to work with me on something <a href="https://interactive-storyteller.com/contact">via my contact form</a> or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/robstenzinger/">message on LinkedIn</a></h2>
    <p>
    Keeping active on projects is how I keep learning and find ways to express my creative wants and wonderings. Also projects ebb, flow, and sometimes need external funding.
    </p>

    <h2>Here you'll find examples of my past work</h2>
    <p>
        Perhaps you're a potential client, employer, collaborator, or curious student. I offer this as a conversation tool. Get to know about me by way of the things I've worked on.         
        <!-- Each teaching example I share gives a glimpse into how I care and practice learning through teaching in order to explore, grow, and share that so others may grow too. Each work example will give you a piece of a map of experience where I've worked in many interesting challenging and fun contexts. You can ask me questions about any of them and I can share a story based on what you're curious about. -->
    </p>

    <h3><a href='/category/work-examples.html'>Work examples</a></h3>
    <p>Whether my primary role is research, facilitation, design hypotheses, game design, or prototyping: each project has a process I follow to understand the needs and context of the team, business, and audience. This includes some form of collaborative discovery, user research, conceptual/early design, testing and refinement whether it&#39;s a prototype app or a learning outcome.</p>
    <!-- <p><a href='/category/work-examples.html'>See the work examples</a>.</p> -->

    <h3><a href='/category/teaching.html'>Teaching examples</a></h3>
    <p>One of my favorite things todo is to make something then share how I did it. With Skillshare alone I've taught more than 1,300 students, been a  
        mentor to dozens, and podcast host to thousands of listeners. I teach workshops at companies of all sizes, at special events like gaming and comic conventions, and in self paced learning modules.</p>

    <h2>Some work samples require more conversation</h2>
    <p>For those I offer these case studies. Still brief, yet more context and detail than a blurb. These are client projects with context of the problem they faced, the process I used, and outcomes. </p>
