## Details

Prepared, taught, facilitated, events based on live-collaboration, mini-creative challenges, and design thinking experiences. These workshops are a way to explore a mini version of a Design Sprint.

## Process

My process is all about making it safe to share and test assumptions, embracing the benefits both of solo and group creativity without falling into group-think traps. 

As shown in the image below, a design workshop is a series of problem framing and exploring. Along the way, combining multiple points of view with prior research and creativity, test ideas as concept. To then express a credible option to explore further or recommendation to table the idea. 

## Outcomes

Typical outcomes include: an expressed and critiqued hypothesis to test, an MVP recommendation, or a brief pitch video.
