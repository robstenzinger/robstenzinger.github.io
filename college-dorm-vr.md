#### Project: College Dorm VR

#### Client: Target

#### Design Challenge: Use new technology to drive back to school sales.

#### Role: UX Lead, Usability Research

What if students traveling from afar and those looking to see their dorm could not only see their dorm but also buy products in a VR environment (built in Unity3d, viewed via Google Cardboard). I worked with a small team of VR prototypers in a UX design and researcher role. I facilitated scrappy intercept based research on the University of Minnesota campus, synthesized and facilitated peer review of findings.
