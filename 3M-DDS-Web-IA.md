#### Project: 3M DDS (Drug Delivery Services) Web Site IA and Iteration

#### Client: 3M

#### Design Challenge: Design a way forward by interviewing a variety of stakeholders with a variety of goals that didn't appear initially to have a lot of common ground.

#### Role: UX, Usability, IA

3M's web presences are all based on a conceptual blueprint - the Information Architecture. This project had multiple phases, looking at usage metrics, user feedback, and in depth interviews. The flow of the project was research > interview > synthesis > IA recommendation. I collaborated with the client and my team by sharing the narrative of each stage, the rationale of the design choices, and evidence gathered. This process made it easy for a wide variety of roles and interests to collaborate.
