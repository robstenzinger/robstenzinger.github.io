Some projects, teams, and situations require an interactive example to explore and to test with their user audience. Three examples of my prototyping work: [Framer example 1](/static/connected app v3.framer/index.html), [Framer example 2](/static/connected app v3.1.framer/index.html), [InVision example](/static/13078390-connected/index.html#/screens/273537332), and [HTML+JS+CSS example](/static/example_prototype/index.html).
