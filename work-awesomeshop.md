#### Client: Target

#### Design Challenge:

#### Role: UX Designer, Design Workshop Facilitation

How might we put a focus on the best of what Target has to offer, based on the products people are talking about socially?

AwesomeShop began with a different user behavior in mind compared to traditional web commerce. Instead of a efficiency or deal-seeking user, we found a vocal group who loved AwesomeShop: those who enjoy the exploration, seeking to treat themselves once hooked by a particularly delightful product.

UX and UI prototyping worked in parallel with other areas (data sourcing, API, company policy) in a small team to test the feasibility (could we make it work well) and desirability (were users using, enjoying, and sharing) during early iterations to later discover the viability (converting exploration into purchases). AwesomeShop now has its own team and continues to iterate.
