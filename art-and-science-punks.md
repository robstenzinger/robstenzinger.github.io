#### About the show

Join the Art and Science Punks as they reflect on their latest art, science and tech projects, gadgets, and experiments. Rob and Kate are lifelong learners with kids exploring and sharing creativity, sometimes with great success and sometimes with great failure, but always with laughter (and occasionally tears).
