#### Project: Food Business Hypothesis

#### Client: Target

#### Design Challenge: Explore revenue growth opportunity in the deli/bakery space

#### Role: UX Lead, Usability Research, Design Co-founder

Led an enterprise growth initiative research project that explored a food service hypothesis.

I conducted several types of field research, from asking deli/bakery team members about their process and constraints to Experience Sampling via Dscout (a qual/quant journal-style research tool). I conducted multiple missions seeking the highs and lows related to this particular experience. Once complete, I compiled my research and presented findings and recommendation to leadership.
