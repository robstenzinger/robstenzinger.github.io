#### Design Challenge:

#### Role: UX Mentor

For the past 10 + year of my career, through formal process and informal request I have been asked to teach UX Design, Design Thinking and Coding to others. I take the commitment to mentor as an honor and each mentoring experience is its own type of design challenge. Discovering where people are at, where they wish to go next, and questions they have along the way is a great learning experience for all involved. I coach others to learn to be comfortable with silences, how to bring out ideas of the introverts in the group, how to honor and build from all ideas shared as well as traditional UX skills.
