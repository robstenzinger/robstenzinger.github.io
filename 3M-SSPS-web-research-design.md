#### Project: 3M SSPS Web Presence Research and Iteration

#### Client: 3M

#### Design Challenge: Recommend a simple way to select among hundreds of similar products with subtly different attributes.

#### Role: UX, Interaction Design, IA

How might the business offer an approachable yet accurate way to filter and select among thousands of safety products and variants? In this design scenario, the client sought recommendations via exploring how others have solved product selection challenges and a summary of recommended options. My work on this project included research, diagramming, and using diagrams as a collaborative communication tool.
