#### Three key principles of the 10 year project that is/was Lean Into Art

**People who love to learn are the best communicators.** We provide a learning system for both students to grow to teach and teachers to continue to learn. To improve, recognize, and enjoy progressing through your creative path, we journal and reflect often. 

**Connecting with an audience is the first priority of communication.** We provide assignments within the classes, forums, and a recognition system practice the whole creative lifecycle with an audience.

**Effective communication artists explore various areas of study.**  We see holistically effective artists as people that are ready to combine ideas from storytelling, visual art, business, science, and engineering to get art projects done.


Podcast on hiatus. Still a wealth of resources for personal and professional development for visual storytellers and teaching artists.
