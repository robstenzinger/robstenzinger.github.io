#### Project: Feed Forward

#### Client: Target

#### Design Challenge: Find a way to use the rich data contained in product reviews for design best practice.

#### Role: UX Research, Coder, UX Design

Designed and created a tool that visualizes product reviews and feedback. Based on research of fellow designers and engineering team members, we discovered a need for product designers (many self-identified as visual learners) to have a tool to explore and engage with data, something besides spreadsheets. Designers use Feed Forward to identify product design best practices and find potential improvements.
