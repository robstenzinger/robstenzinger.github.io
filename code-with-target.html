<p>How do we creatively engage with potential talent and showcase our growing engineering culture?</p>
<p>Code With Target is a gameful recruiting tool. As a game, it's simple: find your way to the contact form by taking a multiple stage challenge based on your technical interests: web engineering, Java, iOS, API, and more. Solve more than one path if you wish to show more of your talents. When Target attended and sponsored software engineering events prior to Code With Target - it was difficult to send the message that Target is growing a new engineering culture with more passion than a traditional big company.</p>
<p>The hypothesis for Code With Target: by providing a playful, gameful intellectual challenge, Target will start conversations with thoughtful, creative, and technical motivated problem solvers who may be interested in working with Target. Potential players/candidates see Talent Acquisition team members shirts, printed materials and swag with calls to action like "curl to unfurl the URL" to then play the game at codewithtarget.com. The hypothesis was proven true through the many players getting in contact with recruiting.</p>
<p>I designed and coded the initial version then brought others on board to own the additional missions/mini games added for the next major version.</p>
