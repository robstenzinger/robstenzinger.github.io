### Design a Branching Story Mini Quest Using Twine

#### Game Design, Storytelling, Coding

If a player can choose any direction in your game, how do you write all of the possible paths? Join cartoonist, game designer, and teaching artist Rob Stenzinger in this awesome interactive game design workshop. In this session you will create your own interactive conversation (aka simple game quest with branching dialogue). We will use the free app "Twine" to make and connect mini conversations with game rules. Great for artists, coders, and non-coders.
